Classification.ipynb provides a full code of crop classification implementation based on Europe dataset. It includes helper fucntions for natural index calculations, training and inference. The implementation was made using Google Earth Enigne, which provides a possiblity for parallel computing in terms of sattelite imagery.

Due to the github troubles with widgets, some output windows are deactivated. You can access the inference map by running the code.
